# Program Name: main.s
# Author: Alfredo Ormeno Zuniga
# Date: 7/13/2025
# Purpose: This program reads input values from the user, performs the conversions using
#          functions defined in libConversions.s, and displays the results.
# Functions:
#   main â€“ Coordinates input/output and calls unit conversion functions
# Inputs:
#   - Miles (for speed calculation)
#   - Hours (for speed calculation)
#   - Celsius (for temperature conversion)
#   - Inches (for length conversion)
# Outputs:
#   - Kilometers per hour (kph)
#   - Temperature in Fahrenheit
#   - Length in feet
